  <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers
  to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.
  The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it
  appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three
  common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one
  of a short story and build upon it.

  paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
  have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story.
  No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use
  creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</p>
